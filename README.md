# DAL

Golang Database abstraction layer

## Goals
- Allow higher level libraries e.g. github.com/goincremental/crud to share a common interface for persistence.

- lightweight interface that can be implemented for specific databases in separate libraries

## Non Goals
- This is not intended to be an ORM
